// login page javascript goes here

// You must have a function here that gets called where user hits Login button OR presses enter.
// The function should take in the username and password as parameters 
// Leave the function empty since we dont have the backend ready yet to receive the login requests.
// it should look like : 

// function login(username, password){
//      leave this empty
//}
